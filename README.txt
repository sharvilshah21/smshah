How to install:

In this project we have written the code for finding the heavy_hitter (The IP who hits the most to the dpdk plane)
To run the project simply set up the dpdk server,login to the account and run the export RTE command and compile the files and then apply build command
to run the code.

Working of the project(what works):

The project works completely and the code is running.

Working of the project(what doesn't work):

Since we have not copied the code from the dpdk server there may be some errors in the execution of the code.
The code on the dpdk server is completly working and we just wanted to copy that code but somehow we could not get the code from T.A.
So we modified the code as per our understanding.
